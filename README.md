# The Orbital Event Ontology (OEO)
An ontology about events in orbit around a celestial body.

The Orbital Event Ontology (OEO), by [Robert J. Rovetto](https://github.com/rrovetto), is a computational ontology and conceptual model for events occuring in outerspace, specifical in orbital space environments, i.e., in orbit about celestial bodis such as planets. With collected datasets, it provides a knowledge graph.

## Description
_See also the Ontology Requirements Specification Document (purchase link coming soon)._

### Scope
OEO represents events or occurrences in orbit, such as orbital collisions between an active [spacecraft]() and an [orbital debris object](https://github.com/rrovetto/The-Orbital-Debris-Ontology/blob/master/README.md) in Earth orbit. Relevant information about the event are included, such as: the parties or participants to the event, their details, the time of occurrence, the temporal duration, the source of data for the information, etc. Given the overlap with other space-related topics, content in ODO may be part of other models by the author and thereby part of the overall set of ontologies under construction. 

### ### Architecture
A self-contained module, usable by itself, but also part of the author's wider [space domain knowledge modeling](https://purl.org/space-ontology) suite of ontologies and other knowledge organization systems.

### Purpose & Value
* To provide a conceptual model, and semantic data model, for annotating and accessing event data
* To support remediation of orbital debris hazards by contributing to data management, interoperability where desired, and AI applications
* To facilitate data-sharing, integration, and fusion among space object catalogues, where desired
* To formally reprsent occurrences in orbital space, and data/content thereof
* To support data and content search and retrieval among relevant domain content (documents, data, etc.) 
* To explore the utility of ontology and various applications
* To continue my studies of astronautical topics
...in order to help ensure global orbital space safety and security of Earth and space-borne assetts (satellites, etc.).

### Status
* In-progress as circumstances permit. Subject to revision. 
* As a unfunded personal project since inception, continued development is dependent on circumstances. Formal support is needed to complete and sustain development to realize the full project vision. The vision is ambitious, multidisciplinary and detailed. [Contact the author](https://ontospace.wordpress.com/contact) to formally support the project in some way. Donations are welcome at the below web-links.  
* ACTIVELY NEEDING: financial support, employer support, stable environment with resources to development and continue learning, etc.
* Desired as my PhD or other graduate project

## Support / Contribute / Desiderata - How you can help 
As an unfunded personal project, you can help by offerring financial support, employment opportunities, graduate study opportunities whereby this can be part of my thesis or projects, co-authorship on papers or proposal, mentorship, voluntary technical expertise/servies for desired functionalities of my project, relevant datasets to apply the ontology to, and to be a user of the ontology(s).
